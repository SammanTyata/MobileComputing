Project Description

## Intended Platform

## Intended Framework/Programming Language
- Swift

## Cross-Platform Development
- Yes

## Explanation
- I have selected iOS because it offers a very user-friendly platform with lots of great tools and features that make app development smoother.
Plus, iOS apps have a strong reputation for performance and security, giving my project a solid foundation to succeed and reach a wide audience.
For development, I will utilize Swift as my programming language, leveraging its superior performance and safety features.

- Additionally, I aim to explore cross-platform development to enhance the app's accessibility for both iOS and Android users. 
To achieve this, I am considering the use of React Native to facilitate broader compatibility across platforms.
